# 🏛️ DAO Creation Toolkit

## 🌐 Overview

**DAO Creation Toolkit** is an open-source framework that enables users, developers, and communities to easily **create, configure, and deploy Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs)** on the **Core Blockchain**.

The toolkit simplifies the complex process of DAO creation by providing pre-built smart contract templates, governance modules, and front-end integration components — empowering anyone to launch their own **community-driven, transparent, and autonomous organization** in minutes.

## 🚀 Key Features

* 🧱 **Modular Architecture** – Plug-and-play modules for governance, treasury, and voting.
* ⚙️ **Custom Governance Models** – Choose between token-based, quadratic, or reputation-based voting.
* 🪙 **Token Integration** – Deploy or integrate your governance token (ERC20 / Core standard).
* 💬 **Proposal Management** – Create, vote, and execute proposals on-chain.
* 🏦 **Treasury Control** – Multi-signature and DAO-controlled fund management.
* 🌐 **Web UI Dashboard** – Intuitive interface for DAO creation and management.
* 🔗 **Core Blockchain Support** – Fully compatible with the Core network’s EVM.

## 🧩 Core Modules

### 🗳️ 1. Governance Module

Handles proposal creation, voting, and execution.

* Proposal lifecycle: *Draft → Active → Queued → Executed*
* Supports configurable quorum and voting duration.
* Enables both **on-chain** and **off-chain (Snapshot-style)** voting.

### 💰 2. Treasury Module

Manages DAO funds via smart contracts.

* Treasury address controlled by DAO proposals.
* Multi-sig fallback for emergency actions.
* Transparent fund movements recorded on-chain.

### 🪙 3. Token Module

Creates and links a governance token.

* Minting, delegation, and voting power tracking.
* Supports existing tokens or new token deployment.

### ⚙️ 4. Factory Module

The heart of the toolkit — deploys entire DAOs with one transaction.

* Deploys governance, treasury, and token contracts.
* Automatically links modules together.
* Assigns deployer as initial DAO admin (configurable).

## 🔒 Example Smart Contract (Simplified)

```solidity
contract DAOFactory {
    address[] public deployedDAOs;

    function createDAO(string memory name, address token, uint256 quorum) public {
        Governance gov = new Governance(name, token, quorum);
        Treasury treasury = new Treasury(address(gov));
        gov.setTreasury(address(treasury));
        deployedDAOs.push(address(gov));
    }
}
```

---

## 🧠 Workflow

1. **User accesses the DAO Creation Toolkit UI.**
2. Enters details: DAO name, governance model, quorum %, and token address (or deploys new).
3. The **Factory Contract** deploys the DAO’s components.
4. Users receive governance tokens and can **create or vote on proposals**.
5. The **DAO Treasury** executes approved proposals automatically.
